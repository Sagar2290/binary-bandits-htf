# EduChain: Decentralized Online Learning Platform

## Overview

EduChain is a decentralized online learning platform that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize course ownership and combat piracy in online education. By tokenizing courses as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, EduChain ensures transparent ownership records and enables users to resell courses within the platform.

## Features

- *Tokenized Course Ownership*: Each course is represented by a unique NFT on the blockchain, ensuring transparent ownership and transferability.
- *Incentivized Course Completion*: Users who complete courses within a specified timeframe gain the privilege to resell them at a price of their choosing.
- *Piracy Mitigation*: By reducing course prices through resale, EduChain mitigates piracy and unauthorized sharing of course content.
- *Dynamic Pricing*: Users can set their own prices when reselling courses, promoting affordability while ensuring fair compensation for educators.
- *Educator Partnerships*: EduChain collaborates with educators and content creators to bring high-quality courses to the platform.
- *Decentralized Governance*: The platform operates on a decentralized governance model, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes.

## Tech Stack

- *Blockchain*: Ethereum for tokenization and smart contract functionality.
- *Frontend*: React.js for the user interface.
- *Backend*: Node.js for server-side logic.
- *Database*: MongoDB for storing user data and course information.
- *Authentication*: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.
